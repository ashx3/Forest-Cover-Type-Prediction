## Context
This dataset contains tree observations from four areas of the Roosevelt National Forest in Colorado. All observations are cartographic variables (no remote sensing) from 30 meter x 30 meter sections of forest. There are over half a million measurements total!

## Tasks
### Forest Cover Type Prediction
Given data about trees and forests, let's try to predict the cover type of a given forest.

We will use a logistic regression model to make our predictions, but first we have to deal with the imbalanced classes.<br>
